### Applications of Reinforcement Learning to Navy Tactical Decision Making

Purpose: evaluate publically available, open-source environments for similarities with Naval problem areas, and implement a variety of Reinforcement Learning algorthims to develop optimal strategies.  Enviroments will be adjusted to alter reward stuctures, environmental cues and complexity to better represent real-world situations
